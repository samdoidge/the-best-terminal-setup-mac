# The best terminal setup for Mac.

* We install zsh via [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) as it is a superior shell to bash. The git plugin by default and improved autocomplete is reason enough.

* We download [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) as it allows visual customisation which the standard Mac terminal does not.

* There are many themes available, but we have chosen agnoster. 

* This requires custom fonts for helpful visual icons, we get them via cloning https://github.com/powerline/fonts and then running ./install.sh.

* A great zshrc file exists in: https://github.com/samdoidge/config. Copy this zshrc file and rename to ~/.zshrc. You will need to replace the DEFAULT_USER with your username.
